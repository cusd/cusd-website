      <h1>What is CUSD?</h1>
      <p>Started in the late fall of 2009, CUSD is an interdisciplinary design-build and sustainability-focused project team. It is entirely student-led and driven by collaboration, and works closely with renowned faculty and knowledgeable professionals to provide an invaluable, hands on experiential learning opportunity. Through comprehensive analysis of every input and its effects on performance within a system, we strive to reach a healthy symbiosis of social, ecological, and economic sustainability. Providing opportunities for students from any major, our diversity - of perspective and project offerings - allows us to continuously push the envelope of innovation and resilience. 
      </p>
      <p>Our projects include an early childhood good education center in Johannesburg, South Africa; a model home with eco-technologies in Nagarote, Nicaragua; on-site energy generation research for the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island in New York City; hands on construction for a community building project in Lansing, NY; the concept design of a hub for student life and outdoor activities on Beebe Lake; and more.</p>
