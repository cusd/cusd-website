        <h3>Beebe Lake Redevelopment</h3>
        <p>CUSD is working with several organizations and student initiatives to design a rehabilitated Japes Lodge on Beebe Lake. Our interdisciplinary team this semester is considering all aspects of the design, including interior, exterior, and landscape architecture, the building’s structure and technology integration. Our team has completed an analysis of Beebe lake and its surroundings to determine a building that will flow naturally with the site. This semester, we will be focusing more heavily on completing the design and working with Cornell Facilities to push the project forward, bringing it closer to fruition. This building will serve as a proper center for Cornell Outdoor Education and Cornell Outing Club, and as a Portal to the Plantations. A bridge between indoor space and the outdoor environment, this comprehensive project has the potential to change the way the entire Cornell community interacts with natural areas on campus. </p>

        <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>Infrastructure is CUSD’s internal support structure. Infrastructure works to handle all of the logistics that go into running CUSD. They manage our communications and public relations, measure our progress, train our members, and keep us connected to our community. Infrastructure is broken up into three different teams: Marketing and Communications, People Development, and Outreach.  The MarComm team manages our communications and media relations. They design and develop all of our materials, handle our branding and publicity strategy, and manage our external communications.  The People Development team works to make sure that we’re constantly improving what we do and how we do it. They train our team members and leaders, identify and promote our best practices and strategies, host collaborative cross-team events, such as critiques, lectures, and workshops; and keep us connected with our past members, partners, and projects. Our Outreach team helps keeps CUSD students connected with our local community. They manage our relations with other student groups and campus entities, host lecturers, and organize sustainability outreach events. </p>
