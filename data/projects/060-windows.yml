lede: "CUSD students were tasked with analyzing the feasibility of installing thermosensitive windows on Olin Hall, one of the main engineering buildings on Cornell University's Ithaca campus."
description:
  "<p>Students have focused on collecting data and using all relevant information to develop a comprehensive model of Olin Hall, working specifically with the modeling tool DesignBuilder. Team members have also conducted extensive research on a variety of thermosenstive window technologies to gauge the best available options. Each of these technologies will be input into DesignBuilder to determine their impacts on the buildingâ€™s energy consumption. After evaluation of all possibilities, students will make a decision on which most effectively reduces energy consumption and, therefore, cuts costs.</p>
