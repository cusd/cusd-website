    Six months ago, we had the opportunity to set a new standard of sustainability. Create an all girls&#8217; school in Sogakope, Ghana, that will endure far beyond our time at Cornell. Â Our organization was founded over five years ago with the mission of bringing our unique vision of sustainability to people in need. Sustainable Education Ghana is our latest effort to utilize this to empower communities to flourish.

  <p>
    For the past six months, CUSD students have been collaborating with Voices of African Mothers to develop a design for the schoolhouse and vision for VAM Village. Our goal is to create an ecological, educational hub that will draw people in from all over Ghana to support women&#8217;s empowerment. In addition to the academic building, plans for VAM Village include a conference center, a multi-purpose academic facility, and agricultural projects.

    Sustainability is not restricted to solar panels and recycling. Sustainability is personally engaging local residents in the development of their community. Sustainability is providing an environmental model for the future. Sustainability is SEG.

    Women in Ghana have a 71.4% literacy rate: over ten percentage points lower than men&#8217;s. Women in Ghana make up less than 15% of total enrollment at technical and vocational schools. Sustainability, as we define it, means providing users with the opportunity for self-empowerment. We must work in tandem, not in isolation, to achieve our goals. SEG will serve the people of Ghana and Togo where opportunities for female education are limited. Our schoolhouse will not only serve as a place for girls to study; it will foster a supportive environment where girls can realize their full potential. Our ultimate mission is to inspire a sense of ecological consciousness, social responsibility, and love of learning in a generation of young girls that they can extend to their surrounding communities and beyond.
